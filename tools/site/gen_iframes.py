"""Writes CANVAS-START-HERE-IFRAMES.md.

Heights are measured, not guessed: every page was rendered headless at 900px
wide, which is about what a Canvas module page gives its content, and the
number below is that height with four percent of headroom. Canvas strips the
script tag out of a pasted page, so the height sender in each file never runs
inside Canvas and the fixed height is what a student actually gets.
