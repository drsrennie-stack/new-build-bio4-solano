   THE PATIENT CHART. One patient, fifteen weeks, five entry points.

   WHAT THIS IS. Use It is 25 percent of the grade and runs every
   week. This file is that assignment. The whole class follows one
   patient for the whole term. In Week 1 a student picks an entry
   point, nursing, medicine, radiology, respiratory therapy, or
   exercise and allied health, and stays in it. Every week they get
   the same chart everyone else gets, plus the data their discipline
   would actually have on its desk, plus a prompt written from that
   desk. All five entry points assess the same competencies. Nobody
   gets an easier version.

   HOW THE CHART IS ORDERED, which students ask about every year.
   The chart is not read in date order. You read one week of
   physiology at a time, and the chart entry for that week is the
   part of her story where that physiology is on stage. Week 3 is her
   arrival in the emergency department because that is where fluid
   compartments are decided. Week 8 is six weeks after discharge
   because that is when the reproductive axis has something to say.
   Week 15 goes back to the first blood gas and reads it again with
   everything the term has taught. Each entry carries its own date so
   the story stays coherent.

   DECIDED Sep 7 2026 by Scrubs:
     - one patient seen five ways, not five patients
     - the chart IS Use It, replacing the standalone four room cases
     - five entry points, respiratory therapy added, exercise kept

   WHAT THIS SUPERSEDES, flagged not deleted:
     - bio005-apply-cases.js, the sixty standalone four room cases
       written earlier the same day, is kept as an alternate bank for
       exam items and discussion seeds. Nothing links to it as the
       graded assignment any more.
     - BIO005-patient-file.html assigns each student a different
       patient from their name. That mechanism is superseded by one
       class-wide patient. The tool is not deleted. See
       compliance-notes.md limitations 17 and 21.

   THE FORWARD REFERENCE PROBLEM, and how it is handled. Scrubs
   raised this on Sep 7 2026: a real patient does not present her
   physiology in course order, so a chart entry in Week 3 can contain
   a bicarbonate of 4 when acid-base is Week 15. An audit found 38
   forward references in this file. Three rules now govern them.

     1. A NUMBER MAY APPEAR BEFORE ITS WEEK. A student can read
        "bicarbonate 4" in Week 3 without being asked anything about
        it. Charts have numbers on them. That is not a problem.
     2. A TOOL MAY NOT BE ASKED FOR BEFORE IT IS TAUGHT OR HANDED
        OVER. Where a week's prompt needs a formula, a rule or a
        definition the course has not reached, the week carries a
        'tools' entry: the tool written out in full, and the week the
        student will actually build it. The page renders this as
        "Before you start" above the chart. Being handed a tool and
        told plainly that you are being handed it is honest; being
        expected to already have it is not.
     3. WHERE THE ASK OVERREACHED, THE ASK WAS CUT. Week 13's
        medicine prompt used to require Henderson-Hasselbalch as well
        as Winter's formula. Winter's is handed over, because her
        breathing in Week 13 makes no sense without it. The
        Henderson-Hasselbalch half moved to Week 15 where it belongs.

   Each 'tools' item is [name, what the student is given, the week it
   is properly built]. Weeks with nothing to hand over have no
   'tools' key and the page renders no box.

   ACCURACY. Every value here is internally consistent and meant to
   be checked. The arrival gas satisfies Henderson-Hasselbalch, the
   respiratory compensation satisfies Winter's formula, the anion gap
   closes as the chloride rises, the corrected sodium works out, and
   the hemoglobin and hematocrit hold their usual ratio. Students are
   asked to do that arithmetic, so it has to survive it.
