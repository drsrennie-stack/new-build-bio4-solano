   BIO 005 Human Physiology, Fall 2026
   bio005-lab-plan.js

   THE WEEKLY LAB, ALL FIFTEEN WEEKS.

   Every week has four parts and the page renders them in this order:

     1. WHAT YOU RUN. Either the PhysioEx exercise, named down to the
        activity so nobody has to hunt through Pearson, or, in the
        weeks that have no PhysioEx exercise, a dry lab.
     2. WHAT YOU RECORD. The data table. This is what the points are
        actually on.
     3. THE CLINICAL CORRELATION. Every week, PhysioEx or not. A
        simulation shows you the physiology with the noise removed;
        the correlation puts the noise back.
     4. LOOK BACK AT YOUR THINKING. The metacognition. Three
        questions, same shape every week: decision, evidence,
        adjustment.

   WEEKS WITH NO PHYSIOEX EXERCISE: 1, 5 and 8. Weeks 1 and 8 already
   had built worksheets. Week 5 had nothing at all and is new here.

   PhysioEx assignments come from physioex-lab-map-fall2026.md and
   agree with the Canvas module list. Week titles come from
   bio005-week-grid.js.
