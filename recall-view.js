/* ============================================================
   BIO 004 Human Anatomy, Fall 2026
   recall-view.js

   Spaced recall, running INSIDE Mastery OS rather than beside it.

   Recall used to live on its own page, bio004-spaced-recall.html,
   which read two of the fifteen card files. Mastery OS knew which
   competency every card belonged to but held no cards at all, and
   linked out instead. So the two halves of the same idea sat in
   two places and neither was complete.

   This mounts the whole recall engine into the Mastery OS page, on
   the one bank in bio004-card-bank.js. One door.

   Wire it after the bank, anywhere on the page:
     <div id="recallMount"></div>
     <script src="bio004-card-bank.js"></script>
     <script src="recall-view.js"></script>

   Deep links, both supported:
     #s-recall            open recall
     #s-recall?comp=ID    open recall filtered to one competency
     ?comp=ID             same, from an external link

   Two kinds of card live in the bank and both are handled:
     multiple choice   options[] + correctIndex, graded by the app
     free recall       q and a only, you grade yourself after
                       committing to an answer out loud or on paper

   Nothing here runs on a timer. A student sets the pace.

     competency mastery, confidence, last-reviewed and next-recall. It
     reads localStorage['bio004-recall-v2'], resolves a topic id to its
     competencies through BIO004_CARD_COMPETENCY_MAP, and counts one
     attempt per entry in each card's history array. attempts/correct
     fields on the card are only a fallback, so the history is what has
     to be written.

     Shape, exactly as the OS expects it:
       { topics: { <topicId>: { cards: { <cardId>: { history:[{correct,at}] } } } } }

     Writing this is the whole reason recall belongs inside the app: the
     dashboard, the weakness list and the daily build all move on their
     own as a student works through cards. */
