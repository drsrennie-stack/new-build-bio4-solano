/* ============================================================
   BIO 005 Human Physiology, Yuba College, Fall 2026
   Section BIOL-5-D9286, Sutter Internet (NET)
   FULLY ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE, lecture and lab.

   Schedule scaffold. Built AFTER the competency map, so every week
   here exists to carry a specific set of competencies rather than a
   chapter number. Read bio005-competencies.js first.

   ------------------------------------------------------------
   WHAT IS CONFIRMED AND WHAT IS A PLACEHOLDER
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   CONFIRMED, from the section listing:
     Term runs 9/8/2026 to 12/16/2026
     Lecture asynchronous online, lab asynchronous online
     Census 9/27/2026
     Last day to drop 11/21/2026
     Capacity 30, waitlist 10

   PLACEHOLDER, needs Scrubs to confirm:
     Whether proctoring is required (gates the whole assessment model)
     Whether Yuba requires a separately stated lab percentage
     Yuba holiday observances for Fall 2026

   RESOLVED:
     Competency set stays at 268, ids unchanged, sensory un-merged (Aug 24)
     Week ORDER adopted Aug 23. Titles stay in student language (Aug 24)
     Grading weights, assessment model adopted Aug 23
     Lab delivery, the lab sits inside the weekly cycle
     Textbook, OpenStax free link, no required purchase

   ------------------------------------------------------------
   ASYNCHRONOUS DESIGN RULES BAKED INTO THIS SCHEDULE
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   1. A week is a container with an open and a close, not a meeting.
      Every week opens Monday 12:00 am and closes Sunday 11:59 pm,
      except Week 1 (opens Tue Sep 8) and Week 15 (closes Wed Dec 16).
   2. Every week has the same four beats so students never have to
      relearn the container: Prime, Build, Practice, Prove.
   3. Nothing requires the instructor to be present at a moment.
   4. Checkpoints replace attendance. Each week has one low-stakes
      graded checkpoint that closes on time.
   5. Exams are windows. An exam that opens Friday and closes Monday
      night works for students on night shift, which is most of a
      physiology cohort headed for nursing.
