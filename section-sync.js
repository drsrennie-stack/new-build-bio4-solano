   BIO 004 Human Anatomy, Fall 2026
   section-sync.js

   ONE section choice across the whole site.

   THE PROBLEM
   -----------
   welcome.html is the chooser. It writes the student's section to
   localStorage under 'bio004-section' as a raw string, one of:

       mw       Class 1, Mon / Wed, afternoon
       tr-am    Class 2, Tue / Thu, morning
       tr-eve   Class 3, Tue / Thu, evening

   The week pages and the course calendar all read that key, so a
   student picks once and those pages follow.

   Mastery OS did not. It keeps its own key, 'mos-section', in its
   own vocabulary ('mw' / 'tr-early' / 'tr-eve'), JSON encoded,
   and it never looked at 'bio004-section'. So a student picked
   their section on welcome, walked into Mastery OS, and got asked
   a second time. Worse, they could answer differently and end up
   with two disagreeing schedules in one browser.

   WHAT THIS DOES
   --------------
   Loaded BEFORE the Mastery OS app script, this seeds 'mos-section'
   from the canonical choice, so Mastery OS starts on the section
   the student already picked.

   THE mos-schedule TRAP
   ---------------------
   Mastery OS resolves its schedule as:

       store.get('mos-schedule')  ||  FALL_SECTIONS[MOS_SECTION]  || ...

   'mos-schedule' is a CACHED COPY of a resolved schedule and it
   wins outright. Updating 'mos-section' alone would therefore do
   nothing for a student who had already been through onboarding:
   the stale cached schedule would keep answering first.

   So when the mapped section actually changes, the cache is
   dropped and Mastery OS re-resolves from FALL_SECTIONS. The cache
   is left alone when nothing changed, so a student who never
   switches sections sees no churn.

   ENCODING, easy to get wrong
   ---------------------------
   'bio004-section' is written with setItem(key, value), a raw
   string:            mw
   'mos-section' is written through Mastery OS's own store, which
   JSON encodes:      "mw"
   Read and write each in its own format. Do not unify them; the
   two readers are independent and both already ship.
