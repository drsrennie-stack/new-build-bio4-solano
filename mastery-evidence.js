   mastery-evidence.js

   ONE EVIDENCE STORE, THREE ENGINES.

   THE PROBLEM
   -----------
   Three separate engines each kept score in its own place, in its
   own shape, and nothing read across them:

     Recall Rx      localStorage['bio004-recall-v2']
                    topics[topicId].cards[cardId].history[]
     Loops          localStorage['loopScores_v1']
                    { loopId: [ {t, right, denom, pct, ms} ] }
     Drawing        nothing. mastery-canvas.html had no storage
                    call of any kind.
     Mastery OS     localStorage['bio004-progress'], a key nothing
                    ever wrote to.

   So the weak spot board could only ever see cards. A student who
   had run every Loop for a unit still read as no evidence.

   WHAT THIS IS
   ------------
   A single append-only log, keyed by competency, that every
   source writes the same shape into:

     { comp, source, got, of, at }

       comp    competency id from competenciesfall2026.js
       source  'card' | 'loop' | 'draw'
       got     how many they got right
       of      how many were possible
       at      ISO timestamp

   Recall Rx is NOT asked to change. mastery-evidence.js reads its
   store directly and folds it in, so card history keeps working
   whether or not a student ever opens anything else.

   NEITHER ENGINE IS ASKED TO CHANGE
   ---------------------------------
   Recall Rx and Loops both keep writing exactly what they already
   wrote. This file reads their stores where they sit and translates
   both into competencies. Adding a fourth engine later means adding
   one more reader here, nothing else.

   The source field is kept on every entry because the Mastery OS
   needs to know which engine to send a student back to when it
   names a weak spot. It is not there to build a side by side
   comparison of the engines.

     Its truth is history[], one entry per attempt, under
     topics[topicId].cards[cardId], shaped
     { at: ISO, rating: n, correct: bool }.
     card-competency-map.js says which competencies a topic speaks to.

     ONE ENTRY PER ATTEMPT, NOT ONE PER TOPIC.
     An earlier version rolled a whole topic up into a single entry
     stamped with the most recent attempt's time. Term totals came out
     right, but anything that asks "what happened today" came out very
     wrong: a student who answered eight cards this morning on a topic
     they have drilled since August would have been told they attempted
     two hundred items today, and the time estimate had one timestamp to
     work from instead of eight. Attempts carry their own times, so they
     are kept apart. */

     THE ONE FACT THAT MAKES THIS WORK
     ---------------------------------
     Loops and this course site are BOTH served from
     drsrennie-stack.github.io. localStorage is scoped to an origin,
     not to a path, so the Loops app's own score history is readable
     from here directly. No postMessage bridge, no export button, no
     change to the Loops code. It already writes everything needed.

     Its store is loopScores_v1:

       { "<loopId>": [ { t: epoch_ms, right: n, denom: n, pct: n, ms: n } ] }

     one entry per scored session. loops-index.js says which
     competencies each loop speaks to. That is the whole connection.

     Watch mode is not scored and writes nothing, which is correct:
     watching a loop is not evidence that anything was retrieved.

     Review sessions are stored under 'review-weak' and
     'review-mixed', which are assembled on the fly and carry no
     record of which loops went into them. Those are skipped rather
     than guessed at, so a mixed review counts for nothing here even
     though it counts inside Loops. */
