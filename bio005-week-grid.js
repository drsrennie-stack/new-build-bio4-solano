   BIO 005 Human Physiology, Fall 2026
   bio005-week-grid.js

   ONE HOME FOR THE WEEK TITLES AND WHAT IS DUE IN EACH WEEK.

   TITLES ARE THE CANVAS TITLES. Scrubs sent the module list from
   Canvas on Sep 7 2026 and asked for that terminology everywhere.
   Students read Canvas first, so Canvas wins any disagreement. The
   descriptive titles in bio005-schedule-fall2026.js ("The chemistry
   that does work in the body") stay where they are as the teaching
   subtitle; these are the names.

   A DISAGREEMENT WORTH KNOWING ABOUT, weeks 5 to 8.
   Three sources in this repo describe those four weeks and they do
   not all agree:

     Canvas          5 The Nervous System   6 Muscle
                     7 Chemical Signaling & Endocrine Control
                     8 Reproductive Physiology
     PhysioEx map    5 Synapses  6 Muscle  7 Hormones  8 Reproduction
     BIO005_WEEKS    5 Synapses  6 Sensory  7 Muscle
                     8 Hormones AND reproduction together

   Canvas and the PhysioEx lab map agree with each other. The schedule
   of record is the outlier: it carries an extra sensory week at 6,
   which pushes muscle to 7 and forces hormones and reproduction to
   share week 8. Weeks 1 to 4 and 9 to 15 are identical in all three.

   This file follows Canvas. bio005-schedule-fall2026.js still needs
   realigning, and the sensory competencies (w7-*) need a home when it
   is. Flagged in compliance-notes.md; not silently re-mapped here,
   because moving 268 competencies is Scrubs' call and not a side
   effect of building a grid.

   WEEKS 13 TO 15 were below the fold in the screenshot. The titles
   here are written in her style from the content of record and are
   marked provisional:'yes'. The grid shows them with a quiet marker
   so nobody mistakes a guess for a decision. Replace them with the
   real Canvas titles and drop the flag.
